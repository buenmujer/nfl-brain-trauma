This is the project I completed as an Insight Health Data Science fellow in San Francisco. I consulted for RC21X, a startup out of Pennsylvania that has developed a brain performance monitoring system that tests different neuromotor centers in several distinct modules. I received a SQL database dump, which contained all their data for various user groups. I decided the most tractable dataset for the short timeframe of an Insight project would be to focus on one user group - former NFL players.
