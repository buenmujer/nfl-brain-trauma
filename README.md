# nfl-brain-trauma
This is the project I completed as an Insight Health Data Science fellow in San Francisco. I consulted for RC21X, a startup out of Pennsylvania that has developed a brain performance monitoring system that tests different neuromotor centers in several distinct modules. I received a SQL database dump, which contained all their data for various user groups. I decided the most tractable dataset for the short timeframe of an Insight project would be to focus on one user group - former NFL players.

**nfl_lrclassify.ipynb** I built a model to predict which former NFL players needed to undergo further psychological evaluation, based on their performance on the test modules. Some of the players had also been evaluated by a psychologist, and I used his determinations as classifications to train the model. This notebooks contains the code for calculating and comparing three model types: logistic regression, random forest and SVM. The data were preprocessed from the original SQL database to get them into the appropriate format for modeling in a (long) series of steps.
